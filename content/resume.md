## Resume

My public resume can be viewed at LinkedIn in links below:

* English: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joubertredrat/
* Brazilian Portuguese: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joubertredrat/?locale=pt_BR

In alternative to LinkedIn, is possble to download resume in PDF version in links below:

* English: [Short](/assets/resume/resume_short_en-us.pdf), [Complete](/assets/resume/resume_en-us.pdf)
* Brazilian Portuguese: [curriculo_pt-br.pdf](/assets/resume/curriculo_pt-br.pdf)

I recommend to use my resume at LinkedIn because I usually update more in this platform instead here.
