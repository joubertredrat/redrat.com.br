## Resume

My public resume can be viewed at LinkedIn in links below:

* English: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joubertredrat/?locale=en_US
* Brazilian portuguese: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joubertredrat/

In alternative to LinkedIn, is possble to download resume in PDF version in links below:

* English: [resume_2021_en-us.pdf](/assets/resume/resume_2021_en-us.pdf)
* Brazilian portuguese: [curriculo_2021_pt-br.pdf](/assets/resume/curriculo_2021_pt-br.pdf)

I recommend to use my resume at LinkedIn because I usually update more in this platform instead here.
