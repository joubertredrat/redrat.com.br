### Why "RedRat"?

My full name is Joubert Guimar√£es de Assis, then RedRat isn't my surname or lastname, but in internet I use RedRat and a lot of people ask me "why RedRat"?

RedRat is my nickname that I use alone or after my first name and this nick have a really good (or strange) explanation.

RedRat is a mix of 3 explanations that complements itself.

* Red translated to Brazilian portuguese is "vermelho", my favorite color.
* Rat translated to Brazilian portuguese is "rato". Rat in medicine is used as object to medical tests and I used this as analogy with me, that like to test anything in IT, source, code, open source projects to study and generate knowledge and share with community.
* RedRat together is word very similar with RedHat, the first Linux distro that I had access when I had 13 years old, on start of my career (One curiosity about this, sometimes I receive random resumes because some people thinks that I work at RedHat).
